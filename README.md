# STARLIGHT_COLLECTOR Readme

## Overview
STARLIGHT_COLLECTOR is an engaging Java-based arcade game where players control a basket to collect falling stars while avoiding meteors. The game features power-ups like speed boosts and magnets, level progression with changing backgrounds, and a high score system. Built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, it offers a structured and extensible design.

## Core Functions
- **Gameplay**: Move the basket left or right using arrow keys to catch stars (10 points), rare stars (+2 or +4 points), and power-ups (faster movement or magnet attraction), while avoiding meteors that end the game.
- **Level Progression**: Advance levels with increasing difficulty and background changes (bg1.png, bg2.png, bg3.png) at levels 4 and 7.
- **High Score System**: Tracks and saves the highest score to a file for display on the menu.
- **Sound Effects**: Includes catch, miss, and game over sounds for immersion.
- **State Management**: Features menu, playing, game over, and level-up states with smooth transitions.

## Purpose
This project is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate Java programming concepts, including object-oriented design, MVC architecture, Swing for GUI, and basic file I/O. It serves as a fun, interactive example for learning game development, debugging, and asset integration in a structured environment.
